# Contributing to Tracer UI Library

First off, *thank you* for considering contributing to the Tracer UI Library.  We want Tracer to be a community built ecosystem, which isn't possible without people like you.

Second, we'd like the contribution experience to be as good as possible. If you have any feedback on your experience, please let us know.

## Storybook

This library is run using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), an open source UI tool. To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
yarn storybook
```

## Making Pull Requests

To submit your changes, make a pull request into `master` from your branch or fork. Fill out the Pull Request Template and ensure that your code passes the `build` and `lint` checks. A team member will review your code. If there are any new or changed components, those visual changes will be reviewed by a team member on [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/).

## Notes

- We write in TypeScript
- Storybook improvements are welcome!
