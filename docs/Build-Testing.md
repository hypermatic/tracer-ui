# Build Testing

Use this command to test your working version of the component library on an existing codebase:

```
yarn test-build /path/to/project
```

## Notes
- This will only work if the folder has a `node_modules` folder with the `@tracer-protocol/tracer-ui` module installed
- You may need to restart any development servers you are running
